    <h2> Explanation of model</h2>
    <h4> Idea </h4>
    We divide large and small stock returns by volatility, which makes them closer to normal and independent identically distributed (IID).
    Stochastic volatility and heteroscedastic models infer volatility values from stock returns data. But we can observe volatility independently.
    This is Chicago Board of Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), available from 1986. After division by VIX, large stock returns become IID normal.
    Finally, we regress normalized small returns over normalized large returns, similarly to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. See the code and data at
    <a href = "https://github.com/asarantsev/Simulator/"> GitHub Repository.</a>
    <h4> Data</h4>
    <p>
    We have data January 1986 - March 2024, <span class = "math inline"> \(T = 459\) </span> time points. </p>
    <p> Volatility is taken from <a href = "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">
        Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) web site</a> monthly average data: Jan 1986 -- Feb 1990,
        <a href = "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VXOCLS"> CBOE VIX S&P 100: VXOCLS</a> and Mar 1990 -- Mar 2024
        <a href = "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VIXCLS"> CBOE VIX S&P 500: VIXCLS</a>
    <span class="math inline">\(V(t), t = 1, \ldots, T.\)</span> </p>
    <p> Large and small stock returns are from
    <a href = "https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html">
    Kenneth French Data Library:</a> <a href = "https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/Portfolios_Formed_on_ME_CSV.zip">
    Portfolios Formed on Size:</a> value-weighted (capitalization-weighted) total returns,
    Large Top 30%: <span class = "math inline"> \(L(t), t = 1, \ldots, T.\)</span>
    Small Mid 40%: <span class = "math inline"> \(S(t), t = 1, \ldots, T.\)</span> </p>
    <p> These are nominal (not inflation adjusted). To adjust them for inflation, we need to subtract monthly inflation rate, computed from the
    (not seasonally adjusted) <a href = "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS"> Consumer Price Index</a> taken from FRED. We get then
    real (inflation-adjusted) versions of returns. </p>
    <h4> Model </h4>
    <p> We model VIX as autoregression of order 1 in the logarithmic scale:
    <span class = "math inline"> \( \ln V(t) = (1 - 0.119)\ln V(t-1) + 0.350 + W(t) \)</span> where
    <span class = "math inline"> \( W \) </span> are independent identically distributed innovations with mean zero. This is a mean-reverting process,
    stable in the long run. The long-term mean of VIX is around <span class = "math inline"> \( 20. \) </span> Remove 12 outliers from 459
    in the right tail and model the rest as normal with mean zero and standard deviation <span class = "math inline"> \( 0.121.\) </span>
    Thus innovations are modeled as a mixture with weights <span class = "math inline"> \( p = 12/459, 1-p\) </span> of the uniform distribution upon
    these 12 outliers, and this normal distribution.
    </p>
    <p> We model large returns as
    <span class = "math inline"> \( L(t) = 3.3557 - 0.1168 V(t) + Z_L(t)V(t)\)</span> for nominal total returns and
    <span class = "math inline"> \( L(t) = 3.1594 - 0.1189 V(t) + Z_L(t)V(t)\)</span> for real total returns.
    Here <span class = "math inline"> \( Z_L \) </span> are independent identically distributed innovations with mean zero.
    They have normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation <span class = "math inline"> \( 0.1941, 0.196 \) </span> for
    nominal and real returns, respectively. </p>
    <p> We model small returns as
    <span class = "math inline"> \( S(t) = 0.000685V(t) + 1.06L(t) + Z_S(t)V(t)\)</span> for nominal total returns and
    <span class = "math inline"> \( S(t) = 0.001412V(t) + 1.061 L(t) + Z_S(t)V(t)\)</span> for real total returns.
    Here <span class = "math inline"> \( Z_S \) </span> are independent identically distributed innovations with mean zero. After removing
    the top right tail outlier, equal to <span class = "math inline"> \( 0.5849, 0.587 \) </span> for nominal and real, respectively,
    the rest is modeled as normal with mean zero and standard deviation <span class = "math inline"> 0.127 </span> in both cases. Thus
    innovations are modeled as a mixture with weights <span class = "math inline"> \( q = 1/459, 1 - q.\) </span>
    </p>
    <p> All three series of innovations are assumed to be independent. </p>
